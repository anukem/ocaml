This is a nonexhaustive list of solutions I came up with working on the CS 3110 course at Cornell.
To run tests, ensure that you have `ocamlfind` and `ocamlbuild` installed from `opam`, an OCaml
package manager.

To run tests: `ocamlbuild -pkgs oUnit [test_name].byte`

I went ahead and moved all solutions to the `cornell_class` folder since this will become the new place I do a bunch of ocaml things.
